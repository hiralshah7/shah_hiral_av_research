# Accessibility Research Audio-Video Application

This is a proof-of-concept application designed to showcase the importance of accessibility in multimedia applications. It is built using Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and Sass.

The application includes two components: an audio component and a video component. The audio component provides a transcript option where users can view a text transcript of the audio content. This is important for users who are deaf or hard of hearing, or who simply prefer to read along while listening. The video component includes closed captions that users can enable by clicking on a button within the video. Closed captions provide text that corresponds to the audio content of the video, making it accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as users who are watching the video in a noisy environment or who prefer to read along while watching.

The entire website is fully functional using only a keyboard, making it accessible to users with disabilities who rely on assistive technology to navigate web pages. This means that all features and functionality of the website, including the audio and video components, can be accessed using only the keyboard, without the need for a mouse or other pointing device.
