1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,160
Some call me nature.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,880
Others call me “Mother Nature.”

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,640
I’ve been here for over 4.5 billion years.

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,740
22,500 times longer than you.

5
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,580
I don’t really need people.

6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,960
But people need me.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,500
Yes, your future depends on me.

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,540
When I thrive,

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,720
you thrive.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,820
When I falter,

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,500
you falter.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,660
Or worse.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,600
But I’ve been here for eons.

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,760
I have fed species greater than you.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,360
And I have starved species greater than you.

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,220
My oceans.

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,740
My soil.

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,580
My flowing streams.

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,920
My forests.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,500
They all can take you.

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,100
Or leave you.

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,560
How you choose to live each day,

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,360
whether you regard or disregard me,

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,440
doesn’t really matter to me.

25
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,620
One way.

26
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,500
Or the other.

27
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,140
Your actions will determine your fate.

28
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,260
Not mine.

29
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,240
I am nature.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,560
I will go on.

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,060
I am prepared to evolve.

32
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,560
Are you?
